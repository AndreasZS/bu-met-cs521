  a. In this context, "interpreted" means that there is a program within Python which takes each line of code and executes it one line at a time. There is no compilation; the code we write is exactly what is executed.
  b. Some advantages of using an interpreted language vs. a compiled language are:
	- not having to perform a compilation step to make code executable
	- code from interpreted languages is (usually) platform independent
	- interpreted languages often offer dynamic typing
	- interpreted languages often offer shell modes to execute code immediately
     some disadvantages of interpreted vs. compiled languages are:
	- execution speed is typically slower than compiled code
	- compilers often warn users about errors in code, especially involving types. Interpreted languages will not do this until the code is executed

  a. A Python comment is text within a Python program that is meant for a human reader, it is not executed.
  b. In Python, a single-line comment can be indicated using a pounch character (# comment). A multi-line comment can be indicated by enclosing the comment in triple double-quotes ("""comment""").
  c. Comments are typically used to provide additional information about the intent or usage of code. They improve the readability of code by explaining the "how" or "why" of a particular piece of code.

  In Python, a namespace is a [a special structure to keep a list of names and their associated values.] The list includes names of variables and other names as well. [The Python interpreter updates both names and values during the course of its operation.]

  a. Whitespace is the absence of a visible character. According to the textbook, whitespace in Python can be made of the following characters:
	- space
	- tab
	- return
	- linefeed
	- formfeed
	- vertical tab
  b. Whitespace matters when it is leading whitespace. This is known as indentation and is used in Python to group a set of statements or expressions together. Whitespace is also important for readability.
  c. Whitespace is always important for readability, but, to Python, whitespace does not matter if it is [in expressions and statements. For example, Y=X+5 has exactly the same meaning as Y = X + 5.] and [blank lines are allowed anywhere and are ignored.]

  a. A statement [does not return a value, but does perform some task. Some statements may control the flow of the program, and others might ask for resources; statements perform a wide variety of tasks. As a result of their operation, a statement may have a side effect.]
     An expression is [a combination of values and operations that creates a new value that we call a return value. If you enter an expression into the Python shell, a value will be returned and displayed.]
     In short, a statement does not return a value but an expression does.
  b. An example of a statement is x = 5. An example of an expression is x + 5.
  c. A side effect means some change that results from executing a statement. For example, the statement x = 5 has no return value, [but it does set the value associated with the variable to 5, a side effect.]
